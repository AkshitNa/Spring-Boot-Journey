# Use of try, catch, finally, throw, and throws keywords in Java

1. try

Where to use: Use it to write code that might cause an exception.
Purpose: To try running code that might fail and catch the error if it happens.

2. catch

Where to use: Use it to catch and handle an exception that occurs in the try block.
Purpose: To respond to an error and prevent the program from crashing.

3. finally

Where to use: Use it to write code that should always run, whether or not an exception occurred.
Purpose: To clean up resources (like closing files or connections) that need to be closed regardless of success or failure.

4. throws [Compile Time Exception]

Where to use: Use it in a method signature to declare that the method might throw certain exceptions.
Purpose: To inform other methods or callers that they need to handle or declare the exceptions that might be thrown by this method.

5. throw [Runtime Exception]

Where to use: Use it to manually create [throw new ExceptionName();]
              and throw an exception when a certain condition is met.
Purpose: To signal that something went wrong in your method.

# Summary

try: Wrap code that might throw an exception.
catch: Handle the exception if it occurs.
finally: Execute code that must run after the try and catch, regardless of whether an exception occurred.
throws: Declare that a method can throw exceptions, so the caller knows to handle them.
throw: Manually create and throw an exception.
